Purpose:

- This site is basically a simple blank page website where you can customize the window title.
- Since Orion Browser does not have folders, I made this to neatly organize some of my pages into their own "folders".
- Orion Browser has a concept of "nested tabs" or "subtabs" where you can place a tab inside another tab. Effectively performing a tree/folder structure.
- If the main tab could be this website, you can pretty much treat it as a folder.
- SSR-safe (state is only on the URL as search params)
- Dark mode (has dark mode, but may also be themable soon if requested)
- Folder favicon, currently just a "folder" (can add more if requested)
